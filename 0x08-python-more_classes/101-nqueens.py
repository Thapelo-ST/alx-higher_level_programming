    The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens
    on an NÃ—N chessboard.
    This program solves the N queens problem.

    The program must and can be only be run this way.
    ./101-nqueens.py 6 any size greater than 8 will not be accepted
    if not it will produce this error

    The solution is presented in this way
